# Day 1 - Jam Setup
We haven’t finalized the game idea yet – we’ll probably discuss that on Day 2 or 3 once everyone’s free to brainstorm.

For now, we:
    Initialized the GitHub repo
    Set up the engine environment
    Made sure everything builds and runs

That’s all for Day 1 – just the boring but necessary groundwork!
